In Kubernetes, PV (PersistentVolume) and PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim) are essential concepts for managing storage in a cluster. 

1. PersistentVolume (PV):
A PersistentVolume (PV) in Kubernetes is a piece of storage provisioned by an administrator that can be dynamically or statically provisioned. It acts as a networked storage volume in the cluster that can be mounted to Pods.

2. PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC):
A PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is a request for storage by a user. It allows users to consume the storage provided by PVs without having to know the details of the underlying storage.
